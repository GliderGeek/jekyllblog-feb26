Hello, and welcome! This is the first post on my new blog, built with **Jekyll** and published on **GitHub Pages**.

## What is this blog about?

This blog is a place for me to share ideas, document things I've learned, and write about topics I care about. Expect posts on:

- Web development and software engineering
- Tools and workflows
- Projects I'm working on

## The tech stack

This site is built with a few great tools:

- **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)** — a static site generator that turns Markdown files into a full website
- **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)** — free hosting directly from a GitHub repository
- **[Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com)** — a CMS that connects to the GitHub repo, letting me edit posts from a nice web interface without touching git directly

The combination means the site is fast, version-controlled, and easy to edit from anywhere.

## Writing with Siteleaf

Siteleaf connects to this repository and provides a clean editor for writing posts and pages. Any changes made in Siteleaf are committed directly to GitHub, which triggers a new build on GitHub Pages.

## What's next?

Stay tuned for more posts. If you'd like to follow along, you can subscribe via the [RSS feed](/feed.xml).
